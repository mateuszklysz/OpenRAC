"""Behaviours: simple movements given to a level's mobys, which the behaviour presets mod plays.

A moby under Game/Mobys with rc1_behaviour metadata (a preset's name) and its numbers is driven by
the mod (in the editor's repository, mods/behaviour-presets): its own update stops and it moves as
the preset says, from where it is placed. Pack writes them beside the level's placements:

    <out>/level_NN/behaviours.json   {"format": 1, "mobys": [{"spawn_id", "preset", <numbers>}]}

The presets and their numbers (metadata rc1_behaviour_<name>; a missing one takes its default):

    spin       speed (degrees a second; below 0 the other way)
    bob        height (units), period (seconds for one up and down)
    patrol     distance (units out along the way it faces, then back), speed (units a second)
    orbit      radius (units), speed (degrees a second; above 0 to its left, below to its right)
    face_hero  speed (degrees a second it turns)
    follow     speed (units a second), distance (how near the hero it stops), range (how near the
               hero must be; 0: always)

and for each, sequence: the class's animation it plays (-1: its own). The mod clamps each number.
