"""Imported moby classes: a moby of a class from another level, which runs as it does there.

A moby under Game/Mobys with rc1_foreign_level metadata (the level the class is from) and the class
of a moby scene the level does not have; rc1_foreign_class_scale is its class's scale, which the
editor draws it at (its own scale is the node's over that). The port registers the class when the level loads, from its
data as its own level's core has it, and runs its update in its own level's program, swapped in for
the call (port/game/rac1/host/foreign_class.c). Pack writes, beside the level's placements:

    <out>/level_NN/classes.tsv           one "class<TAB>level" a line
    <out>/level_NN/classes/<class>.bin   the class's data from its level's core

and places the moby with a copy of the first moby of that class in its own level: its fields and its
pvar block. The mobys its links name there come with it (linked), as does each class its update
can make that the level lacks (spawns.py), and its level's tables, moved to where it stands, go
to worlds.bin (world, write_worlds). Rac1 only, on any of its discs. Any level's class can come
into any other: only its level's data is swapped in for the call, and every level's data ends
below every level's program end.
