"""Pack the levels edited in Godot back into the game's level data.

    python3 editor/extract.py pack baserom/SCES_509.16.iso assets/levels/rac1/pal assets/packed/rac1/pal
    python3 editor/extract.py pack baserom/SCUS_971.99.iso assets/levels/rac1/ntsc assets/packed/rac1/ntsc

For each level whose scene differs from the disc, writes that level's
gameplay file (the placements) as the game stores it, and a list of the disc
sectors each file replaces. Either disc: each level header holds a gameplay
copy per video mode. Both native ports select the 60 Hz copy on their own disc
(disc.Version.gameplay), so that copy is the one read and replaced:

    <out>/level_NN/gameplay_<version>.wad   the level's gameplay file, compressed
    <out>/patches.tsv                 first sector, sector count, file: one line per file
    <out>/changes.txt                 what was changed, in words
    <out>/packed.json                 the disc it was packed from (overrides.py stacks it for that disc only)
    <out>/level_NN/cutscenes/         the level's cutscenes, as OpenRAC Editor wrote them beside its
                                      scene, for the editor-runtime mod (pack_cutscenes)

The disc image is never written. The native port reads `patches.tsv` (its
`--mods` option) and serves those sectors from the files instead of the disc.

What it packs, for now: mobys that were moved, turned, scaled, given another
class or other values (the `rc1_*` metadata), added (a copy made in Godot, or
a class scene of the level dropped in) or deleted; the level's collision
(collision_scene.py) and its moby classes' collision, edited in the class
scenes (moby_collision_scene.py: a class's edit is every moby of that class
in that level), both into the level data's core. Ties and shrubs are packed
for the native port, as the files it draws them from (scenery.py:
<out>/level_NN/placements.json). The gameplay data (pvars, links, groups, volumes,
paths, cameras, sounds, level settings) is gamedata.py's, called from pack_level. Terrain
is a later step, as are classes the level does not have.

A moby the scene has as the extractor wrote it keeps its bytes on the disc,
so a scene nobody edited packs to nothing, and a level whose mobys were only
edited differs from the disc's in those records alone. Adding and deleting
write the table again, and with it what names mobys by their place in it
(gameplay.py).
