// Skins: a moby of the level drawn as another model (from another level or game) while the game
// runs its own class's logic. The editor's pack writes them beside the level's placements
// (editor/skins.py): skins.json names each moby by its spawn id, the model (a skinned .glb with its
// own animations, read as a prop's is: load_model and load_prop_rig), the scale its own is
// multiplied by, and which of the model's animations plays for each of the class's sequences.
// Only what is drawn changes: the game, its collision and its logic never see a skin.
